requestAbsence.php, im thinking about adding username but im not sure about it, but ai said dont
add new column to table absence_table_abs, but rather just join table via credsId

i think requestAbsence.php form only need kelas, jurusan, status, no need username nor name 
because the $_SESSION already cover the username and name and it was more valid because its straight
from the login data and also keep the absence_table_abs cleaner

and on viewAttendance.php, it will join table abs and creds and it will pull name

bruh, profile logic makes me want to vomit, it has quite complex logic, but damn i knew it, so ill
use left join, so it will throw all data from table creds and only matching data from table profile,
and also i think i want to add double data insert on register but i dont think that was the correct 
logic so for now i think i will stick on emptying profile table and i will use query insert then
update, rather than only insert like usually

i think ill make another table for user profile and the logic is it will always update table creds 
rather than insert cuz the data always exist cause by login, and for the profile table it will have
2 query, insert and update, first thing is check whenever data exist, if exist then it will update
and if the data not found then it will insert

for the edit profile image i think ill keep it by default deafault.jpg, and if user decide to edit
their pp then it will update table profile where id = session credsId and if somehow user edit their
PP first then ill make the condition to insert, rather than update, and also im planning to format 
the image name into something like id + date maybe?
