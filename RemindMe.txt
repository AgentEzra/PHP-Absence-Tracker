requestAbsence.php, im thinking about adding username but im not sure about it, but ai said dont
add new column to table absence_table_abs, but rather just join table via credsId

i think requestAbsence.php form only need kelas, jurusan, status, no need username nor name 
because the $_SESSION already cover the username and name and it was more valid because its straight
from the login data and also keep the absence_table_abs cleaner

and on viewAttendance.php, it will join table abs and creds and it will pull name
